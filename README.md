# PopGen-in-R
Hello there! And welcome to the nth repository/blog/tutorial for pop gen in R. This was born mostly as a reminder to myself, and for now this has not changed. So look at it as a nice place to look at someone elses analyses flow, rather than a guide (and it is most definitely not a course).

So far, I have added:

- a [list](https://github.com/MboiTui/PopGen-in-R/blob/main/R_Packages_I_Often_Use.md) of packages I use and how to install them
- a [list](https://github.com/MboiTui/PopGen-in-R/blob/main/Handy.md) of handy commands for data manipulation of genind/genlight files
- a [guide](https://github.com/MboiTui/PopGen-in-R/blob/main/HPC_fastStructure.md) on how to run fastStructure on the HPC
