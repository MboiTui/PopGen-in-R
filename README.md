# PopGen-in-R
A guide on doing population genomics and other genomic analyses in R.

Hello there! And welcome to the nth tutorial/guide for pop gen in R. This was born mostly as a guide/reminder to myself, and for now this has not changed. So look at it as a nice place to look at someone elses analyses flow, rather than a guide (and it is most definitely not a course).
