# PopGen-in-R
A guide on doing population genomics and other genomic analyses in R.

Hello there! And welcome to the nth tutorial/guide for pop gen in R. This was born mostly as a guide/reminder to myself, and for now this has not changed. So look at it as a nice place to look at someone elses analyses flow, rather than a guide (and it is most definitely not a course).

So far, I have added:

- a [list](https://github.com/MboiTui/PopGen-in-R/blob/main/R_Packages_I_Often_Use.md) of packages I use and how to install them
- a [guide]() on how to run fastStructure on the HPC
